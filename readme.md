# Geolize.css #
Geolize is a lightweight CSS reset that renders standard HTML and CSS elements like it's 1997.

What does it do?
------
* Geocitifies styles for a wide range of elements.
* Makes your site look really awesome.

How do I use it?
------
With Bower:

`bower install geolize.css`

This will also include all images and a test.html file.

Don't wanna use a package manager? Download geolize.css and include it in your HTML like this:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="geolize.css">`

We've included some image presets to make your site look even MORE awesome. If you want to use those too, make sure to download the `img` folder too (or use Bower).

Do you have a demo?

We even have a styleguide! Check out https://stupidhackathonams.github.io/geolize.css/.
